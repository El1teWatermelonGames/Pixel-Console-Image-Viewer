# Pixel Console Image Viewer

This is a very simple image viewer project for the console using a custom filetype, Pixel Console Image (.pci). This project was inspired by learning how image files are stored from my computer science lessons.

## How to create a file

To create a file just make a file with any name with the .pci file extension. These files use hexadecimal for determining each pixel color, you can create a new row of pixels just by making a new line in the .pci file.

## Color Code
- 0 BLACK
- 1 BLUE
- 2 CYAN
- 3 GREEN
- 4 MAGENTA
- 5 RED
- 6 WHITE
- 7 YELLOW
- 8 LIGHT BLACK
- 9 LIGHT BLUE
- A LIGHT CYAN
- B LIGHT GREEN
- C LIGHT YELLOW
- D LIGHT RED
- E LIGHT MAGENTA
- F LIGHT WHITE

## How to render an image

To render an image place the .pci file inside the same directory as the renderer (this applies to **all** versions of the program). Once you run the render just enter the image file's name. You can render the image with the color code printed over the image.
